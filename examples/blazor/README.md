# PSPDFKit Web Example – Blazor

This example shows how to integrate [Nutrient Web SDK](https://www.nutrient.io/web/) into either a Blazor Server or WASM app.

This example demonstrates Standalone only.

## Prerequisites

- [.Net 6.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PSPDFKit/pspdfkit-web-example-blazor.git

cd pspdfkit-web-example-blazor
```

After you have downloaded [Nutrient Web SDK](https://customers.www.nutrient.io/download/web/latest), place the contents of the `dist` directory in `/wwwroot/pspdfkit/`.

Make sure your `/wwwroot/pspdfkit/` folder contains the file `pspdfkit.js` and a `pspdfkit-lib` directory with library assets.

You can then build and run the example using `dotnet watch run` from the root folder.
